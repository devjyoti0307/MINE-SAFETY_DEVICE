 Designed an innovative IoT-based air monitoring system for mining environments that detects air quality, filters pollutants, and 
measures pH levels using sensors like MQ135, DHT11, and dust sensors; real-time data is transmitted via an ESP8266 WiFi module to 
cloud platforms like ThingSpeak for remote monitoring and analysis.
